### Hello there
> General Kenobi

I'm a passionate programmer with a couple years of experience (not counting my own time I have spent on learning though) who started tolearn programming, so I could create games. At that time it was easier toland a job as a web developer so I needed to switch things a bit and that is how I fell in love with .NET and its technology stack. However I'm open minded, so I'm taking a peek at other languages and trying to understand their concepts and approaches, so I could try to use them with C#. I also consider myself ambitious and I do not like to procrastinate, thus I'm doing my best to learn new things everyday. Other than that, I love to read science fiction and fantasy books.
